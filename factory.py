"""
Factory Method Pattern encapsulates object creation logic and provides flexibility for instantiating related objects without specifying their concrete classes in the client code.

Client code doesnâ€™t need to know about the internal instantiation details of Cat or Dog.

This makes the code more maintainable and extensible.

Benefits of Factory Method Pattern
Advantage	Description
Encapsulation	Object creation logic is hidden from the client.
Loose coupling	Client depends on the factory, not concrete classes.
Extensibility	Easy to add new types (e.g., Bird) with minimal client code changes.
